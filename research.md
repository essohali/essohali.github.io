## Research Overview

My research lies in **applied statistics**, with a focus on modelling
complex data structures frequently encountered in real applications.

A central theme of my work is the development of statistical models for
count data exhibiting excess zeros, overdispersion, and multicollinearity.

## Main Research Themes

### Statistical Models for Zero-Inflated Data

I develop probabilistic models adapted to datasets where classical
assumptions fail, particularly in health and economic applications.

### Regularized Estimation

My work explores penalized and ridge-based estimators to improve
stability and interpretability in high-dimensional settings.

### Simulation-Based Statistical Inference

Simulation studies play a key role in evaluating model behaviour
and methodological performance.
