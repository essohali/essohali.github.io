## Research Impact and Applications

My research in applied statistics is motivated by real-world data
characterised by complex structures such as excess zeros,
overdispersion, and multicollinearity.

These features frequently arise in modern datasets across multiple
domains, making classical statistical models insufficient.

## Health Data Applications

Zero-inflated count models naturally appear in health sciences,
where outcomes often include a large proportion of zero observations.
My work develops robust estimation procedures adapted to these settings,
improving interpretability and inference reliability.

## Economic and Social Data

Economic datasets frequently involve sparse or irregular count data.
My research on regularized estimators and contraction methods provides
stable modelling tools suitable for empirical economic analysis.

## Methodological Contributions to Data Science

Beyond specific applications, my work contributes to data science by:

- improving statistical modelling of complex datasets,
- developing regularized estimation methods,
- enhancing model interpretability,
- supporting simulation-based evaluation of learning procedures.

## Interdisciplinary Perspectives

The methodological nature of my research facilitates collaborations
with researchers from applied domains, including health sciences,
economics, and data-driven disciplines.

## Future Impact

Future work aims to extend statistical learning approaches for complex
data structures and to strengthen interactions between statistical
theory, machine learning, and applied data analysis.
