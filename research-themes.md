# Research Themes

My research focuses on the development of statistical methodology for complex data,
with an emphasis on count data modelling, regularization methods, and robust inference.

## Count Data and Zero-Inflated Models

I develop probabilistic models for count data exhibiting excess zeros,
overdispersion, and complex dependence structures.
My work includes zero-inflated Bell, Probit Bell, and constrained regression models.

**Topics**
- Zero-inflated regression models
- Count data modelling
- Overdispersion and heterogeneity
- Statistical inference for discrete data

---

## Regularized and Penalized Estimation

I study regularization techniques designed to address multicollinearity,
high dimensionality, and model instability.

**Topics**
- Ridge and contraction estimators
- Penalized likelihood methods
- Regularized estimation under censoring
- Model stability and interpretability

---

## Robust and High-Dimensional Inference

Recent work investigates robust variable selection and dimension reduction
methods under data contamination and complex structures.

**Topics**
- Robust statistics
- Variable selection
- Sufficient dimension reduction
- High-dimensional inference

## Applications

Methodological developments are motivated by real-world applications:

- Health sciences
- Economics
- Applied data science
