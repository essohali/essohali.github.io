## About

I am a researcher in **applied statistics and statistical learning**,
developing methodological tools for the analysis of **complex and zero-inflated data**.

My research focuses on statistical modelling, regularized estimation,
and inference methods motivated by applications in health sciences,
economics, and real-world data analysis.
