## Teaching Philosophy

My teaching approach aims to bridge **mathematical foundations** and
**practical data science applications**.

I seek to help students develop both theoretical understanding and practical
skills, enabling them to analyse real-world data with rigorous statistical
reasoning.

---

## Pedagogical Principles

### 1. From Theory to Applications

I emphasise the connection between mathematical concepts and real data
problems.  
Examples and projects are used to illustrate abstract ideas and motivate
learning.

---

### 2. Active Learning

Students learn statistics best by practicing.  
I integrate exercises, computational notebooks, and project-based learning
into my courses.

---

### 3. Progressive Skill Development

My teaching adapts to different levels:

- **Undergraduate:** foundations in probability and statistics
- **Master:** statistical learning and modelling
- **Advanced courses:** data science projects and methodological autonomy

## Courses Taught

| Year | Course | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 2025 | Probability and Statistics | L3 |
| 2024 | Statistical Learning | M1 |
| 2024 | Data Science | M2 |

## Student Supervision

I supervise student projects and internships, guiding students in:

- problem formulation,
- statistical modelling,
- scientific communication.

---

## Teaching Interests

I am particularly interested in developing courses at the interface between:

- statistics,
- machine learning,
- data science,
- applied modelling.

---

## Future Teaching Development

In the future, I aim to contribute to innovative teaching formats combining
theoretical lectures, computational practice, and interdisciplinary projects.
