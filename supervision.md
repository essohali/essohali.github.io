# Supervision

I actively supervise students at different academic levels,
including doctoral research, master theses, and applied data science projects.
My supervision focuses on statistical modelling, count data analysis,
and applied data science applications.

## Supervision Interests

My supervision activities focus on:

- statistical modelling for complex data,
- zero-inflated and count data models,
- machine learning for structured data,
- applied data science projects,
- statistical computing and visualization.

## Pedagogical Approach to Supervision

I encourage students to develop:

- methodological rigor,
- reproducible research practices,
- programming skills (R, Python),
- scientific writing and presentation skills.

Supervision integrates both theoretical understanding and practical
applications motivated by real-world datasets.
