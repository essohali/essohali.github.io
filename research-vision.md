## Research Vision

My research aims to develop **statistical and machine learning methodologies**
for analysing complex and high-dimensional data arising from modern scientific
and societal applications.

I work at the intersection of:

- statistical learning
- probabilistic modelling
- data science
- applied mathematics

My objective is to bridge rigorous statistical theory with real-world data
challenges.

## Scientific Objectives

### 1. Statistical Learning for Complex Data

I develop statistical learning methods adapted to high-dimensional,
structured, or dependent data.  
This includes model-based learning approaches combining interpretability and
predictive performance.

---

### 2. Applied Statistical Modelling

A central aspect of my research is the construction of probabilistic models
motivated by applications.  
I am particularly interested in translating domain-specific problems into
statistically tractable formulations.

### 3. Interpretable and Reliable Machine Learning

Modern data science requires models that are both accurate and interpretable.
My work explores statistical guarantees and robustness properties of learning
algorithms.

## Applications and Interdisciplinary Perspectives

My research is motivated by applications involving real-world datasets,
encouraging collaborations across disciplines and interactions with
industrial partners.

These applications provide new methodological challenges and opportunities for
impact beyond academia.

## Future Research Directions (5-year perspective)

In the coming years, I aim to:

- develop scalable statistical methods for large datasets,
- strengthen links between statistical modelling and machine learning,
- contribute to interdisciplinary collaborations,
- participate in national and international research projects.

## Long-Term Perspective

My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of statistically grounded
data science, combining theoretical advances with impactful applications.
